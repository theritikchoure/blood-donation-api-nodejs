# Blood Donation Management System ( BloodBuddies )

## Project Objective

BloodBuddies is a website in order to help the patients and their attenders who are seeking blood at a particular location. This MERN project is designed in such a way that it keeps detailed information as well as separate information of all the locations where the blood donor is available and what kind of blood is available.


BloodBuddies does not store blood but it stores the information about the blood donor and blood recipient(patients or attenders), we can say it store the information or database of the blood donors available in the particular location. Because there was a time when some needs bloods in urgent, then this website proved to be his best friend and help the person finding the place nearby him very quickly.

The system is basically an E-information system for getting the database for the blood availability in any particular arena.

## Existing System

In existing Blood Donation Management System, not all users can get access to the information because of the low working of the application or is not able to access any site. Sometimes the information is not updated or available for a particular place. In existing system the security is less and latest updates and uploads are not so frequent.

## Proposed System

In the proposed Blood Donation Management System, in this software once the timer is being arranged, it put up updates and uploads automatically and does not need anyone to do so. Also it is easily available due to its speed and programming part and using it is quite an easy task and well as due to its speed the information which will be available by one or two clicks, will get available in few seconds only.


## Modules

The following integrated website has the given modules:

- **Administrators:** They have the right to add all the details to the system such as blood groups availability, the quantity in which they are available, locations nearby. Admins can import and export the details about the donors and patients.

- **Donor:** Donor is the one who donates the blood. The information of all the donors is being maintained. So that in case of emergency when the blood is not available then asking directly to the donor to provide his blood will help the people a lot.

- **Patients or Attender:** The one who needs blood can give their basic information and contact to blood donor from the donor's list.
